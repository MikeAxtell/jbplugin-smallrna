# Small RNA Plugin

JBrowse plugin to support small RNA analysis

Based on the JBrowse tack type "Alignments2", the small RNA alignments track shows individual reads. The differences are:
1. Reads are colored by size not strand
2. Reads can be filtered by size or multimapping
3. There is animal and plant specific coloring because plant's don't have piRNAs. Plant coloring is the default.
